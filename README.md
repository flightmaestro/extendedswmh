The SWMH corpus is a multilabel corpus of 5 main communities from reddit which are 'Anxiety', 'bipolar', 'depression', â€˜Suicide Watch' and 'offmychest' with about 50,000+ total instances. We labeled 5,000 instances of the swmh dataset with negative and positive sentiments, and emotion labels such as anger, fear, hopefulness, hopelessness, joy, sadness, calmness, and disgust. This is to help in the multitask learning process. According to the labels, 1 means there is sentiment or emotion present in the text instance and 0 means the sentiment or emotion is not present in the text instance.
